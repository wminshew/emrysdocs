## What is emrys?

While exploring, you'll notice every page has a feedback link at the bottom.
We ask that you use it!
No piece of software or writing is perfect, and we need all the help we can get to make it better.
We intend to open source the user client in the coming months, but for now this site & [email](mailto:support@emrys.io) will have to do.
We thank you in advance for your thoughtful feedback on our service & documentation.

## Emrys is a funny name. What's it mean?
Emrys is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin">Merlin</a>'s first name in Welsh.
Following Arthur C. Clarke's famous quote ("Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"), we believe programming is modern wizardry.
But mostly we just like how it sounds.
